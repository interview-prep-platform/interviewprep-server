If I change the order of a method’s modifiers, will it still work?  Is public static void main the same as public void static main?  What about void static public main?; Yes (void has to be right in front of main), otherwise it works, but the convention is to put the visibility modifier at the start; dzone.com, Nick Bennett

When would you pick an ArrayList versus LinkedList?; ArrayList still has indexing like an array, but can increase its size as add things. LinkedList references chains of objects.  ArrayList is faster if you know the access, LinkedList better if you are reading from the end or adding to the end.  If you need to retrieve or get values from somewhere in the middle of the structure, then ArrayList is faster.  If you are going through a list in order, then use a LinkedList, but if you are adding to middle, then want to use ArrayList.  ;DeepDive
